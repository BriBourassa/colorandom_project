## Abstract ##
In today's world of fast moving design trends, it may be critical to have the ability to generate and save randomized color palettes within moments. Thankfully, our group project "Color Random" is exactly such a tool. Straightforward to interact with, our application allows for users to click a button to generate a series of 5 random colors based off of hexadecimal color codes. Users can then click individual colors within the palette in order to lock them as a selection while regenerating more colors in each unlocked slot (up to the total of five colors per palette). When a user is happy with the palette they have selected, they can click the 'save palette' button in order to add it to the saved palettes section on the right of the page. If a user changes their mind and wishes to remove a palette from the saved section, they may do so by clicking the trash icon that exists alongside each palette in storage.
